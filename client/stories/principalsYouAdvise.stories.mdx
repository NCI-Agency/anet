## View Principals You Advise

Keeping track of who you’re advising is a critical part of the TAA mission. ANET provides a couple
of ways to view the principals you’re advising, also known as your *counterparts*.

One way to find this information is to look at the page with your own details. In the top bar, next
to your name, there's an *(edit)* link. Click that, and you’ll be taken to a page with your profile
information, including your contact information, the position you hold, and reports you’ve authored
or are mentioned in. In the “Assigned Principal” section of the page, you’ll see a subsection called
“Advises”. This section lists principals you advise.

Another way to find your counterparts is by clicking on “My Work” on the left hand menu, and then
clicking on “My Counterparts”. On that page you can also see whether you have pending assessments
for your counterparts that you still need to complete.

You can also get to your profile information by navigating to your advising organization. You do
this by clicking on “My Work” on the left hand menu, and then clicking on “My Organization”. You can
find yourself under “Supported Positions”.

To see if other advisors are advising your principal, you can click on their name to view their
profile information. Under the “Assigned Advisor” section, you’ll see the subsection called “Is
advised by” which lists their advisors.

### Sensitive Information for Your Counterparts

As stated in the [Sensitive information and Authorization Groups](/story/anet-user-stories-introduction--page)
section, people might have several fields containing sensitive information. If they are one of your
counterparts, you are allowed to view that information.
