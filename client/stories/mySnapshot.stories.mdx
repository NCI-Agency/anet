## My Snapshot

The “My Snapshot” on the homepage gives you a quick look into some important information about your reports. Each of these sections quickly shows you how many reports of that type there are. To see the reports themselves, just click on the number.

### Reports Pending Approval

In the first box, labelled “Reports Pending Approval” you can see how many of your reports need to be approved before they’ll be added to the daily rollup. If you’re a Super User, this number tells you how many reports have been submitted by advisors that you need to review.

### My organization’s recent reports

On a given day, several advisors in your advising organization may submit reports. The number of reports submitted by members of your organization is listed in the second section of the “My ANET Snapshot”.

### My reports in the last 24 hours

This section quickly displays reports you have drafted or submitted in the last 24 hours.

### Upcoming Engagements

This section displays how many future engagements you have created. Future engagements are draft reports which have a date in the future. To learn more about future engagements, please see that section above.
