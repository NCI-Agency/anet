**Drafting and Submitting Engagement Reports**

You have a couple of options for when you create your reports. If you create a draft report before your engagement, you can set a future date and find that report listed as one of your future engagements. If you create a report after the fact, you can submit the entire report to your approval chain all at once.

Here’s how you draft and submit a report:

1. From the home page, find the “New Report” button. It’ll be towards the top right of the page. If you’re a Super User or Administrator, you’ll need to click onto the “Create” button and select “New Report” from the options.
2. This button will take you to a page called “Create a new report”. You’ll enter information in the fields on the page. Some fields are required, while others (like Tasks) are optional.
3. Meeting Goal: First, fill out what the goal of the meeting was. This field will be used to populate the executive summary used in the daily rollup, so it’s best to complete the sentence “The goal of the is meeting is to”.
4. Engagement date: Next you’ll select the engagement date. When you click into the field, a calendar will display showing the current month. You can press the “today” button at the bottom to easily select the current day, or select another date.
5. Location: As you being to type the location where the engagement happened, results that match what you’ve typed will begin to appear. You can keep typing, or select one of the options from the dropdown. If what you’ve entered has no matches, the box will turn red. If you’ve typed in your location properly and it does not appear, ask your Super User to add that location to ANET.
6. Cancelled engagements: If your engagement was cancelled, select the checkbox next to “This engagement was cancelled”. When you select that option, you’ll be prompted to select the reason for why the engagement was cancelled. Some fields on the form will no longer be visible. You’ll only need to fill out "People involved in this engagement" and next steps after this point. You can add detailed comments if you’d like.
7. Atmosphere: You can record the engagement’s atmosphere, by selecting the thumbs up icon for a positive atmosphere during your engagement, the neutral face for engagements that were neither positive nor negative, and the thumbs down icon for negative engagement. If you select either neutral or negative icons, you’ll be prompted to add details explaining why it was not positive.
8. People involved in this engagement: In this section, you can add the advisors and principals who attended your engagements. By default, you will be listed in this section. People you have added in recent reports will appear in the “Shortcuts” section on the right-hand side of Attendees. To add one of them, just click on their name. For others, start typing their name into the text field next to “Attendees” and select their name from among the results. If you don’t see the person you are trying to add, ask your Super User to add them to ANET. In this section, you can also select who the primary advisor and principal in the meeting were. By default, the first advisor and principal added will be selected as the primary. To select someone else, just select the check mark to the left of their name.
9. Tasks: If your meeting related to one of your advising organization’s Tasks or Pillars, you can select it by searching for it in the text field to the right of "Tasks". If your meeting did not relate to a task, it’s okay to leave this part blank.
10. Key outcomes: In the field next to “Key outcomes”, you have 250 characters to provide a summary of the most important points of the engagement. This will appear in your report’s executive summary, so make sure it’s the most impactful information for leadership and other advisors to see.
11. Next Steps: In the next steps field, you have 250 characters to describe the next steps you’ll be taking on this issue or with this principal. This will appear in the executive summary.
12. Add detailed comments: If you feel that there is more information to include in your report, click on the “Add detailed comments” button. When you click on it, an open text field will appear where you can write as much as you’d like.
13. Saving your report: To save the draft version of the report, you can click on the “Save report” button at the top, or very bottom, of the page. This will create a draft of your report. You can click save at anytime to hold onto the work you’ve already completed. On this page, you can preview what your report’s executive summary will look like and see if there are any required fields that you still need to fill out. If you’d like to edit your saved draft, click on the “Actions” button on the top of the page, then select “Edit”. You’ll be able to edit and resave your report.
14. Submitting your report: When you’re happy with your draft report and are ready to submit it, scroll down to the bottom of your draft, and click on the “Submit report” button. This will send the report to the first person(s) in your approval chain.
15. Viewing your approvers: After you’ve submitted your report, it goes to the first person in your advising organization’s approval chain. You can see who needs to approve your report while viewing that report. By scrolling down to the section called “Approvals”, you can see each approval step in your organization. By clicking on each step, you can see the individuals who can approve your report.
16. Daily Rollup: Once your report gone through your organization’s approval process, it will be added to the daily rollup. You can view the daily rollup by clicking on “Daily Rollup” on the left-hand menu of the page.
