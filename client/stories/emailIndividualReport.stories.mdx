## Emailing Individual Reports

When you read a report that you think someone else may want to read, you can quickly and easily email it to them from within ANET. To send someone a report:

1. Click the “Actions” button on the top right of the report
2. Select the “Email Report” option
3. You’ll be prompted to search for the name of the person you’d like to send the report to.
4. You also have the option to include a comment in the email. Once you’ve added the comment, click the “Send Email” button and you’re all set.
