## Creating a new person

As a Super User, you are responsible for creating new people when your organization members come
onto the mission, or need to mention someone in a report who has not previously been mentioned.

To create a new person in ANET:

1. Click on the “Create” button on the top right-hand side of the page.
1. Then, select “New Person” from the options.
1. You’ll be prompted to fill out information about that person.
    1. Name: fill out their name (first and last).
    1. Role: Select advisor or principal from the dropdown menu of options.
    1. Email: You can optionally add an email address for that advisor or principal.
    1. Phone: You can optionally add a phone number for this person.
    1. Rank: You can select the military rank of the person, or identify that they are a civilian or
       contractor.
    1. Gender: You can select the person’s gender.
    1. Nationality: You can add which country the person is from (their nationality, not the country
       they are currently working in).
    1. End of tour: You can add their end of tour date.
    1. Biography: This is an open text field where you can record helpful information about this person.
    1. Position: You can identify which position this person is filling by searching for the
       position (by name or billet/tashkil number). If their position does not already exist in the
       system, you can leave this blank and create the position for them.
1. Once those fields have been completed, click the “Save person” button at the bottom of the page.
