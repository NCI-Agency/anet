## Updating the Security Banner Text and Color

Administrators have the ability to modify the color and text of the security banner. To modify these
settings, start by clicking on “Admin” on the left-hand menu on the home screen. From there, you
can change the text of the security banner by entering your desired text in the “Security banner
text” field. Similarly, you can change the color by entering your desired color in the “Security
banner color” field. For the color, you can use names, rgb values or hex strings; see e.g. the
[W3Schools Colors Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/default.asp).

## Updating the General Banner Text and Level and Visibility

Administrators have the ability to modify the color and text of the general announcement banner. To
modify these settings, start by clicking on “Admin” on the left-hand menu on the home screen.

From there, you can change the text of the general banner by entering your desired text in the
“General banner text” field.

The banner level can be changed by entering one of the following announcement levels.

* **Blue** - shows a blue banner on top of the page, the default value
* **Green** - shows a green banner on top of the page
* **Red** - shows a red banner on top of the page
* **Yellow** - shows a yellow banner on top of the page

The banner visibility can be changed by choosing one of the following three settings:

* **Users only** - only show users the banner, the default value
* **Super users and administrators only** - only show super users and administrators the banner
* **Users, super users and administrators** - show users, super users and administrators the banner

The banner will only be visible when a text has been entered and the user role fits the selected
visibility level.

## Authorization Groups for Sensitive information

As stated in the [Sensitive information and Authorization Groups](#sensitive-information-and-authorization-groups)
section, access to sensitive information is restricted to the chosen authorization groups. As an
administrator, you define the available authorization groups, and who is in them. Under the
**“Admin”** section there's an entry **“Authorization groups”** where you will find a list of the
currently defined authorization groups. From the list you can view details of each group, and also
edit them by clicking **“Edit”**. From the top right **“Create”** button you can create new
authorization groups.

Make sure to give each authorization group a descriptive name, so report authors know which ones to
choose. Add the positions belonging to the group. The people currently occupying those positions
(as shown in the *Current Occupant* column in the details page of the group) will have access to
sensitive information restricted to this group. Setting a group to *Inactive* means the group will
no longer be shown to report authors when selecting groups for sensitive information text in an
engagement report.

To add groups in the dictionary, you need to record the group's unique identifier, called *uuid*,
which you can find in the URL bar of your browser. E.g. if you're looking at an authorization
group's detail page, the URL will end with something like
`…/admin/authorizationGroups/39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d` ⇒ the uuid you need in this
case is `39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d`; in the dictionary you'd specify that as:
```
        authorizationGroupUuids: ['39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d']
```
To add more groups, separate them with a comma, like so:
```
        authorizationGroupUuids: ['39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d', 'c21e7321-7ec5-4837-8805-a302f9575754']
```
