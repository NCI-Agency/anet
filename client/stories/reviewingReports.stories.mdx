## Reviewing Reports

Super Users (or advisors who are added to an organization’s approval chain), may need to review advisors’ reports before they are released to the daily rollup. One way to quickly see which reports you need to review:

1. Start on the ANET homepage and click on the box within the ANET snapshot called displaying a number and the words “Pending my approval”.
2. Clicking there will take you to a page of the reports that are waiting on your approval.
3. Select the report you’d like to review by clicking on the “Read full report” button visible on the bottom right of the report summary.
4. There, you’ll be able to see the entire report, including the executive summary which will be displayed in the daily rollup.
5. Below the report summary, you can can request changes and comment by clicking on the “Request changes” button. Similarly, you can edit or approve the report by clicking on the “Edit report” or “Approve” buttons, respectively.
6. If you request changes, you’ll be prompted to include a comment with the request, if you have not already done so. Once changes are requested, the report is resent to the author to review.
7. If you approve the report it will go to the next approver if there is one, or it will be released to the daily rollup if you were the final approver.
