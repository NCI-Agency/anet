## Advisor Assessments

Advisor assessments are configured through the dictionary and can be used to assess advisors from
different organizations using different sets of questions. When you are creating a report for a past
engagement, you can assess the attendees by answering the questions at the bottom of the report
form. An example of a question set can be found below. Here you can select the role of the linguist
and can answer different sets of questions based on that role.
