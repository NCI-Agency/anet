## Reviewing Reports

Super Users (or advisors who are added to an organization’s approval chain), may need to review
advisors’ reports before they are released to the daily rollup. One way to quickly see which reports
you need to review:

1. Start on the ANET homepage and click on the box within the ANET snapshot called displaying a
   number and the words “Reports pending my approval”.
1. Clicking there will take you to a page of the reports that are waiting on your approval.
1. Select the report you’d like to review by clicking on the “Read Report” button visible on
   the bottom left of the report summary.
1. There, you’ll be able to see the entire report, including the executive summary which will be
   displayed in the daily rollup.
1. Below the report summary, you can can request changes and comment by clicking on the “Request
   changes” button. Similarly, you can edit or approve the report by clicking on the “Edit report”
   or “Approve” buttons, respectively.
1. If you request changes, you’ll be prompted to include a comment with the request, if you have not
   already done so. Once changes are requested, the report is resent to the author to review.
1. If you approve the report it will go to the next approver if there is one, or it will be released
   to the daily rollup if you are the final approver.
