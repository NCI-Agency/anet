## Emailing Individual Reports

When you read a report that you think someone else may want to read, you can quickly and easily
email it to them from within ANET. To send someone a report:

1. Go to the report's preview page.
1. Click the “Email report” button.
1. You’ll be prompted to enter the email addresses of the people you’d like to send the report to.
1. You also have the option to include a comment in the email. Once you’ve added the comment, click
   the “Send Email” button and you’re all set.
