## Drafting and Submitting Reports

You have a couple of options for when you create your reports. If you create a draft report before
your engagement, you can set a future date and find that report listed as one of your future
engagements. If you create a report after the fact, you can submit the entire report to your
approval chain all at once.

Here’s how you draft and submit a report; please note that the label for each of the report fields
may differ slightly from what is listed here, some labels or terms may be redefined by the ANET
administrator.

1. From the home page, find the “New Report” button. It’ll be towards the top right of the page. If
   you’re a Super User or Administrator, you’ll need to click onto the “Create” button and select
   “New Report” from the options.
1. This button will take you to a page called “Create a new report”. You’ll enter information in the
   fields on the page. Some fields are required, while others (like Tasks) are optional.
1. Meeting Goal: First, fill out what the goal of the meeting was. This field will be used to
   populate the executive summary used in the daily rollup, so it’s best to complete the sentence
   “The goal of the meeting is/was to”. You have 250 characters for that.
1. Engagement date: Next you’ll select the engagement date. When you click into the field, a
   calendar will display showing the current month. You can press the “today” button at the bottom
   to easily select the current day, or select another date. Depending on the configuration of ANET,
   you may also be able to select the meeting time.
1. Duration (minutes): Depending on the configuration of ANET, this field may or may not be shown.
   If it is there, it allows you to fill in the duration of the meeting, e.g. 90 for a meeting that
   lasted an hour and a half.
1. Location: As you being to type the location where the engagement happened, results that match
   what you’ve typed will begin to appear. You can keep typing, or select one of the options from
   the dropdown. If what you’ve entered has no matches, the box will turn red. If you’ve typed in
   your location properly and it does not appear, ask your Super User to add that location to ANET.
1. Cancelled engagements: If your engagement was cancelled, select the checkbox next to “This
   engagement was cancelled”. When you select that option, you’ll be prompted to select the reason
   for why the engagement was cancelled. Some fields on the form will no longer be visible. You’ll
   only need to fill out “People involved in this engagement” and next steps after this point. You
   can add detailed comments if you’d like.
1. Atmospherics: You can record the engagement’s atmosphere, by selecting Positive, Neutral or
   Negative. If you select either Neutral or Negative, you’ll be required to add details explaining
   why it was not positive (for Positive, these details are optional).
1. People involved in this engagement: In this section, you can add the advisors and principals who
   attended your engagements. By default, you will be listed as the primary attendee and author in
   this section. People you have added in recent reports will appear in the “Recent attendees”
   section on the right-hand side of Attendees. To add one of them, just click on their name. For
   others, start typing their name into the text field next to “Attendees” and select their name
   from among the results. If you don’t see the person you are trying to add, ask your Super User to
   add them to ANET. In this section, you can also select who the primary advisor and principal in
   the meeting were. By default, the first advisor and principal added will be selected as the
   primary. To select someone else, just click the circle to the left of their *Primary* label. A
   report can also have multiple authors. By default you will be the sole author (and you can't
   remove yourself from the author list). Click the checkbox in the authors column for advisors you
   want to make additional authors.
1. Tasks: If your meeting related to one of your advising organization’s Tasks, you must select it
   by searching for it in the text field to the right of “Tasks” or by clicking a task under the
   “Recent Tasks”.
1. Key outcomes: In the field next to “Key outcomes”, you have 250 characters to provide a summary
   of the most important points of the engagement. This will appear in your report’s executive
   summary, so make sure it’s the most impactful information for leadership and other advisors to
   see.
1. Next Steps: In the next steps field, you have 250 characters to describe the next steps you’ll
   be taking on this issue or with this principal. This will appear in the executive summary.
1. Key details: In this text field you should write up a detailed report. You can use mark-up, like
   adding three-level headers, lists, boldface fonts, etc. You can also link to other objects in the
   ANET database by linking to them via the *ANET Link* option.
1. Sensitive information: If you need to record sensitive information related to this engagement,
   click the *Add sensitive information* button. Another (mark-up enabled) text field will appear
   that will hold the sensitive information, together with a list of Authorization Groups that you
   must add to record who is allowed to access the sensitive information. If you're unsure which
   authorization groups you should add, ask your supervisor or administrator for guidance. The
   sensitive information you add here will be visible to you and other report authors you may have
   added, to people in the authorization group(s) that you select, and to administrators.
1. Saving your report: To save the draft version of the report, you can click on the “Preview and
   submit” button at the top, or very bottom, of the page. This will create a draft of your report,
   and take you to a page that shows a preview of the report, and, if complete, allows you to submit
   the report for approval. You can click the save button at any time to hold onto the work you’ve
   already completed (note that there's also an automatic save every 30 seconds). On the preview
   page, you can view what your report will look like and see if there are any required fields that
   you still need to fill out. If you’d like to edit your saved draft, click on the “Edit” button at
   the top of the page. You’ll be able to edit and re-save your report.
1. Submitting your report: When you’re happy with your draft report and are ready to submit it, you
   can click on the “Submit report” button. This will send the report to the first person(s) in your
   approval chain.
1. Viewing your approvers: After you’ve submitted your report, it goes to the first person in your
   advising organization’s approval chain. You can see who needs to approve your report while
   viewing that report. By scrolling down to the section called “Workflow”, you can see each
   approval step in your organization. By clicking on each step, you can see the individuals who can
   approve your report.
1. Daily Rollup: Once your report gone through your organization’s approval process, it will be
   added to the daily rollup. You can view the daily rollup by clicking on “Daily Rollup” on the
   left-hand menu of the page.
