## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are a way to keep an eye on updates to specific objects. The “My Subscription Updates”
table shows three columns: the subscription, when it was last updated, and through which object. You
can look at subscriptions as a kind of feed: when I subscribe to something, I get a feed of all
updates relevant to that object. By subscribing to a location, an organization, a person, a
position, a report or a task, you will receive an update for each change to that object, or for each
note that is written on that object.

Additionally, when an engagement report is *Published* or *Cancelled*, subscriptions to the
following objects will also receive an update:

* to the report itself
* to the report's attendees
* to the report's attendees' positions
* to the report's advisor organization and principal organization
* to the report's tasks
* to the report's location

So for example, if someone edits a location, subscriptions to that location will get an update. And
additionally, if that location is used in a report, and you subscribe to that location, publishing
that report will show a subscription update for that location.

The idea behind it is: say you're managing a location, then you want to know what goes on at that
location, so you subscribe to that location, and see all engagement reports for that location (as
well as any updates to, or notes posted on, that location itself). Or: you're responsible for a
task, then you want to see what happens around that task, so you subscribe to that task, and see all
engagement reports that relate to that task (as well as any updates, or notes posted on, to that
task itself).

You can subscribe to an object by e.g. searching for it, then going to that object's details page,
and clicking on the grey icon:

<img src={subscribeIcon} />

If you've already subscribed to the object, the icon will change to the green icon:

<img src={unsubscribeIcon} />

and clicking on it will unsubscribe you from that object. Under **My Work** on the navigation menu
you find an entry **My Subscriptions**. Clicking on it shows you a page with two tables: your update
feed (*My Subscription Updates*) and your subscriptions (*My Subscriptions*). You can browse through
both tables; they also have a clickable icon to unsubscribe from objects you are no longer
interested in.

Note that subscriptions are linked to your *position*, so if somebody else takes over your position,
they will 'inherit' your subscriptions. Think of it as a good way to transfer knowledge of which
objects are of specific interest for a person in that position.
