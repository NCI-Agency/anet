## Delete Draft Reports

If you ever need to delete a draft report — if, for example you accidentally create one — you can do
so by clicking the *Delete this report* button at the bottom of the report's edit page.

Please note that you cannot delete reports that have been submitted for approval, or those which
have already been approved and added to the daily rollup.
