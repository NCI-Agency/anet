## Editing report change requests

If your reviewer returns your report with requested changes, you’ll receive an email letting you
know. The email will include the comment explaining why the report needs changes. You’ll need to
edit and resubmit the report.

In order to edit the report, you’ll first need to navigate to the report in ANET. You can do this by
clicking on the link provided in the email, or clicking on “My Work” on the left-hand menu, then
clicking “My Reports”. When you find and click into the report, you can review the comment the
reviewer left.

To edit the report, click on the “Edit” button on the top right of the page. You’ll then be editing
a draft version of the report. Once you’ve made the changes you need to make, you can save and
resubmit the report for approval.
