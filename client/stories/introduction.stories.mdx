# Getting Started in ANET

Welcome to ANET! We hope you’re finding it easy to use. In the information below, we describe a
little bit about how the system works, and some of the major uses cases for this software. If you do
need help, you can read below to see if there are instructions for what you’re trying to do. If your
question still isn’t answered, please email the system administrator at [BLANK].

## What is the Advisor Network (ANET)?

ANET is an online tool designed to aid the Resolute Support mission to train, advise, and assist
(TAA) the Afghan government. It does this by giving advisors an easy way to record the outcomes of
their engagements, and share that information across the mission as needed. ANET’s advanced search
capabilities make it easy for advising organizations and mission leadership to gain context on
engagements which can shape future decision making.

## Using ANET for the first time

### Accessing ANET

To log in for the first time, you’ll need to log onto a computer with access Afghan Mission Network.
When you’ve done that, open up a web browser and go to the ANET webpage. Then you’ll be able to use
the Advisor Network (ANET).

ANET logs you in with your existing credentials, so as long as you can log into your computer, you
should be able to access ANET and already be logged in to your account.

### Checking your information

The first time you visit, you’ll first be taken to a page that shows your profile information.
Please make sure that your name (in canonical form: LAST NAME, First name(s)), rank, position, and
other information is correct. You’ll need be associated with a position in order to see your
organization’s reports and have your reports approved by your Super User.

You can add a position to your profile by typing the position into the field next to the word
“Position”. As you type, we’ll search the existing positions to find what you’re typing in. If we
don’t find your position, you’ll need to ask your Super User to create the position for you. Your
Super User can also add you to a position once they’ve created the position.

After this information is up to date, you’re ready to use ANET.
