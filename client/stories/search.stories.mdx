## Searching

Searching in ANET is the best way to quickly find information. At the top of the home page, there’s
a search button where you can enter a keyword. Keywords are things like people’s names, locations,
topics, and others.

Once you’ve entered your search, you’ll be taken to a page of search results. These results will
show you any reports, people, positions, locations, tasks, or organizations that contain that
keyword.

## Saved Search

If you want to be able to quickly check the results of a search, you have the ability to save your
searches. For example, if you were interested in seeing all reports that use the word “corruption”,
you could search for it as described above. To easily check the search results, you can save that
search by clicking the “Save search” button at the top. Give your saved search a meaningful name so
you will be able to find it.

When you’ve saved your search this way, the results will display under “My Work” with the “My Saved
Searches” option. You can also toggle between multiple saved searches by clicking on the dropdown
menu at “Select a saved search” and selecting the search results you’d like to view. Should you no
longer be/interested in that saved search, you can remove it by clicking the “Delete Search” button.
Initially, selecting a saved search only shows you the reports matching that search; you can also
view the complete search results for a saved search by clicking the “Show Search” button. In
addition to the matching reports, this will also show you possible results for other types of
information.
