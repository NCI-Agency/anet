## Editing People, Positions, Locations, Organizations, and Tasks

There are several ways to find the person, position, locations, organizations, or tasks that you’d
like to edit. In most cases, the easiest way to find this information is to search for it by name,
using the search bar at the top of the home page. For example, if you want to search for the person
“John Smith”, just enter that name in the top search bar, and look through the results for the
person you’re hoping to edit.

Once you find what you’re hoping to edit by searching, click on it from the search results page. You
will be taken to a page that lets you view the detailed information about that person, place, or
object. When you’re there, click on the “Edit” button on the top right-hand side of the page. You’ll
then be able to make and save changes.

## Understanding People and Positions

As a Superuser, you’re responsible for managing the people and positions in your organization in
ANET. When you’re managing your organization, it’s helpful to understand the relationship between
people and positions.

### Positions

Positions live within organizations and have relationships assigned to them to indicate who is
advised by that position, or who advises that position. Positions are also
what get assigned permissions in ANET. That way, as people rotate in and out of theatre, their
permissions, roles, and counterparts remain constant as they take over someone’s role. When you create
or edit a position, you can add the person currently filling that position to it.

### People

People fill positions. When you create a person, you add details about them, like their rank,
contact information, and a biography. You can also add that person to an existing position when you
create or edit a person. If you need to add them to a new position, that doesn’t exist in ANET yet,
you’ll need to create the position and then add the person to it.

## Replacing someone in an existing position

When someone new comes into theatre you’ll likely need to create that person and add them to an
existing position. We recommend that you start by creating that person as described in the
directions above. When you reach the bottom of the page, you can search for the position that person
is going to fill, and assign them that way.

Alternatively, you can create the person who is coming into theatre. Then, you can navigate to the
existing position. Click on the “Actions” button, then select the “Edit” option. From there, under
the “Person” field, replace the current position holder with the person you just created.

## Creating an approval chain for your organization

As a Superuser, you can create [approval chains](/docs/3-anet-admin-stories-1-approval-chains--docs) for your organization.
These approval chains indicate who needs to review submitted reports before they’re added to the daily rollup.

The approval chain is a series of steps. In each step, you can add one or more person to review
reports. If there is more than one person in a step, it means that either of them can review the
report. One of the two (but not both) must review the report for it to move on to the last step.

After the report has been approved by someone in the final step, their report will go to the daily
rollup. If, along the way, one of the reviewers request changes to the report, the report will be
returned to the author for corrections. The report will then need to be resubmitted.
