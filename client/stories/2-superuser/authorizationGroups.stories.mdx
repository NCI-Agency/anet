## My Authorization Groups

As stated in the [Authorization Groups for Sensitive information](/docs/0-anet-stories-sensitive-information-and-authorization-groups--docs#sensitive-information-and-authorization-groups)
section, an administrator can define the available authorization groups, and assign superusers to
manage them.

If a superuser has been assigned administrative rights on authorization groups, these will be
available as *My Authorization Groups* under the *My Work* section.
