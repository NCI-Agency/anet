## Creating a new person

As a Superuser, you are responsible for creating new people when your organization members come
onto the mission, or need to mention someone in a report who has not previously been mentioned.

To create a new person in ANET:

1. Click on the “Create” button on the top right-hand side of the page.
1. Then, select “New Person” from the options.
1. You’ll be prompted to fill out information about that person.
    1. Name: Fill out their name (last and first names).
    1. Email: You can optionally add an email address for that person.
    1. Phone: You can optionally add a phone number for this person.
    1. Rank: You can select the military rank of the person, or identify that they are a civilian or
       contractor.
    1. Gender: You can select the person’s gender.
    1. Nationality: You can add which country the person is from (their nationality, not the country
       they are currently working in).
    1. End of tour: You can add their end of tour date.
    1. Biography: This is an open text field where you can record helpful information about this person.
    1. Position: You can identify which position this person is filling by searching for the
       position. If their position does not already exist in the
       system, you can leave this blank and create the position for them.
1. Once those fields have been completed, click the “Save person” button at the bottom of the page.

Note that Administrators see an additional User field, where they can select Yes or No depending
on whether this new person should be able to access ANET or not.
