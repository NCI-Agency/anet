## Sensitive information and Authorization Groups

In general, almost all information in ANET is accessible to all fully authenticated users. However,
in some places, ANET can record sensitive information. This comes in two different flavors:

1. sensitive information text as part of engagement reports
1. custom sensitive information fields for e.g. people, as defined in the ANET dictionary
   (configuration)

For both flavors, access to the sensitive information is first and foremost restricted to people
holding active positions in the chosen authorization groups. For engagement reports, authors are
allowed to select these authorization groups themselves. For the custom sensitive information
fields, the authorization groups that have access are defined in the ANET configuration, by the
application administrator.

In addition to people in the authorization groups, sensitive information in engagement reports is
also accessible to the report's author(s). And sensitive information for people or positions is also
accessible to those people's or position's counterparts.

Administrators define the available authorization groups, and who is in them. These groups should
have a descriptive name, so report authors know which ones to choose. Also, administrators have
access to all information.
