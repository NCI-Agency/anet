## Creating Future Engagements

Future engagements are a great way for you to keep track of your upcoming engagements. To create a future engagement, start by creating a new report. In the date field, select the date of the future engagement. Feel free to fill in as much information as you already know---information like the attendees, location, and meeting purpose.

Then, just click save at the top or bottom of the page. This will save your future engagement as a draft report which you can come back to after your engagement and finish filling out the information.
