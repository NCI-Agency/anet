## Creating Future Engagements

Future engagements are a great way for you to keep track of your upcoming engagements. To create a
future engagement, start by creating a new report. In the date field, select the date of the future
engagement. Feel free to fill in as much information as you already know â€” information like the
attendees, location, and meeting purpose.

Then, just click save at the top or bottom of the page. You can complete your future engagement
report (fewer fields are required than for past engagements), save and submit it, after which it
will go through the planning approval workflow. When the engagement date has passed, you will
receive a notification that you should complete your report, which now has draft status again, as it
has now become a report for a past engagement.
