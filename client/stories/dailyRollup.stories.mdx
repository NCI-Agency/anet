**Daily Rollup**

ANET makes it easy to see recent reports. At anytime, you can click on “Daily Rollup” on the left-hand menu and see the reports that have been approved within the last 24 hours for engagements within the last [BLANK]. You can scroll through the report summaries, and click on the “Read full report” link to see the entire report.

The daily rollup also includes a graph visually display how many reports from each AO have been submitted within the last 24 hours. You can also quickly view cancelled engagements here.
