## Setting a Default Approval Organization

As an administrator, you have the ability to modify the default approval organization.
The default approver organization if the organization of the primary advisor does not specify any
[approval chain](/docs/3-anet-admin-stories-1-approval-chains--docs).

Typically, if reports go through these approval steps it means
that the person who submitted the report needs to be placed into a position, which will add them to
an organization.

If, for example, you have the admin organization acting as the default approval organization, you’ll
be responsible for reviewing reports submitted by an advisor without an organization. If you see
this, you should check to see if they’ve been added to a position, and whether that position has an organization.

To set the default approval organization, start by selecting “Admin” from the left-hand menu bar on
the home screen. From there, you’ll see a field called “Default approval organization”. To change
the default approval organization, enter the uuid of the organization that you would like to be
the default organization. Once you’re done, click the “Save settings” button at the bottom of the
page.
