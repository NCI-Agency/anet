## Authorization Groups for Sensitive information

As stated in the [Sensitive information and Authorization Groups](/docs/0-anet-stories-sensitive-information-and-authorization-groups--docs#sensitive-information-and-authorization-groups)
section, access to sensitive information is restricted to the chosen authorization groups. As an
administrator, you define the available authorization groups, and who is in them. Under the
**“Admin”** section there's an entry **“Authorization groups”** where you will find a list of the
currently defined authorization groups. From the list you can view details of each group, and also
edit them by clicking **“Edit”**. From the top right **“Create”** button you can create new
authorization groups.

Make sure to give each authorization group a descriptive name, so report authors know which ones to
choose. Add people, positions, and/or organizations belonging to the group. Access will be granted
to the people in the group, plus people currently occupying the positions in the group, plus people
occupying positions in the organizations (including their sub-organization hierarchy) in the group.

Setting a group to *Inactive* means the group will no longer be shown to report authors when
selecting groups for sensitive information text in an engagement report.

To add groups in the dictionary, you need to record the group's unique identifier, called *uuid*,
which you can find in the URL bar of your browser. E.g. if you're looking at an authorization
group's detail page, the URL will end with something like
`…/admin/authorizationGroups/39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d` ⇒ the uuid you need in this
case is `39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d`; in the dictionary you'd specify that as:
```
        authorizationGroupUuids: ['39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d']
```
To add more groups, separate them with a comma, like so:
```
        authorizationGroupUuids: ['39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d', 'c21e7321-7ec5-4837-8805-a302f9575754']
```
