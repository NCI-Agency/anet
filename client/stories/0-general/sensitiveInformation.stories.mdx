## Sensitive information and Authorization Groups

In general, almost all information in ANET is accessible to all fully authenticated users. However,
in some places, ANET can record sensitive information. This comes in different flavors:

1. sensitive information text as part of engagement reports
1. custom sensitive information fields for e.g. people, as defined in the ANET dictionary
   (configuration)
1. optionally: restricted access to point-of-contact details (phone numbers, email addresses)

For all flavors, access to the sensitive information is first and foremost restricted to people
holding active positions in the chosen authorization groups. For engagement reports, authors are
allowed to select these authorization groups themselves. For the custom sensitive information
fields and optionally the restricted point-of-contact details, the authorization groups that have
access are defined in the ANET configuration, by the application administrator.

Note that there is a difference between this key being absent from the dictionary, and defining an
empty list for this key. The absence of the key means anyone can access this information, and an
empty list (`authorizationGroupUuids: []`) means nobody can access this information.

Examples:

```
fields:
  person:
    customSensitiveInformation:
      example1:
        # only authorization groups 39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d and
        # c21e7321-7ec5-4837-8805-a302f9575754 can access this field:
        authorizationGroupUuids: ['39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d', 'c21e7321-7ec5-4837-8805-a302f9575754']
        type: date
        …

      example2:
        # nobody can access this field, because the list is empty:
        authorizationGroupUuids: []
        type: date
        …

      example3:
        # anyone can access this field, because `authorizationGroupUuids` is not defined
        type: date
        …
```

Administrators define the available authorization groups, and who is in them. These groups should
have a descriptive name, so report authors know which ones to choose. Also, administrators have
access to all information.

In addition to people in the authorization groups:
1. sensitive information in engagement reports is also accessible to the report's author(s)
1. custom sensitive information for people or positions is also accessible to those people's or
   position's counterparts
1. restricted point-of-contact details are accessible by superusers for positions and organizations
   in the hierarchy they manage
