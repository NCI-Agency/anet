# Different User Roles in ANET

Users of ANET can have three different roles:

1. Normal, Unprivileged Users
1. Superusers
1. Administrators

## Normal, Unprivileged Users

Most of the people using ANET will be normal, unprivileged users. They can search through the
available information, read published reports, view details about organizations, locations and such,
and draft engagement reports to be submitted through the approval workflow.

For more detailed information on users' duties, see
[ANET User Stories](/story/1-anet-user-stories-0-introduction--page)

## Superusers

In addition to everything the normal, unprivileged users can do, ANET superusers have a few extra
capabilities. A superuser not assigned to any organization can:
-   create new locations
-   update existing locations
-   create new principals (interlocutors, persons)

In addition, when an ANET administrator has assigned you as superuser to one or more organizations,
you can also:
-   update people in that organization hierarchy
-   create new positions in that organization hierarchy
-   update existing positions in that organization hierarchy
-   create new sub-organizations in that organization hierarchy
-   update existing organizations in that organization hierarchy

[ANET Superuser Stories](/story/2-anet-superuser-stories-0-introduction--page)

## Administrators

Administrators have full access rights to ANET. They can do everything superusers can do, and of
course also everything normal, unprivileged users can do. On top of that, they can for example
create new locations, advisors, organizations and tasks.

They can also merge several objects, which comes in useful if there are two (or more) duplicate
objects created in ANET. Merging them means only one of them will be left, and all references will
be updated to point to the correct, merged object.

Engagement reports that have gone through the full approval workflow become ready for publication.
They will be held for a configurable amount of time (e.g. 24 hours) before being published, which is
the final, immutable state of a report. However, an administrator can also decide to publish such a
report manually, ahead of this time, or, if the report does not match the required criteria, reject
it, thus sending it back into the approval workflow.
