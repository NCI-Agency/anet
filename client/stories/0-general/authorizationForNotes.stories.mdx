## Authorization for notes

In ANET, there can be two basic types of notes:

-   _FREE_TEXT_
-   _ASSESSMENT_

There are two main GraphQL endpoints to manipulate notes, through:

-   `NoteResource::createNote`, `NoteResource::updateNote`, `NoteResource::deleteNote`, which all
    three take exactly one note
-   `ReportResource::updateReportAssessments`, which can take multiple instant assessments for a
    report (assessments for people and tasks of that report can be combined in this call)

These all fully check whether the note or notes passed to it are completely valid. And more
importantly, they also check whether the user is authorized to perform this action.

## _FREE_TEXT_

These are the notes in the sidebar. A _FREE_TEXT_ note can be linked to any number of related
objects.

-   admin can read, create, update and delete any _FREE_TEXT_ note
-   user can read all _FREE_TEXT_ notes for objects they are allowed to see
-   any user can create _FREE_TEXT_ notes
-   user can update a _FREE_TEXT_ note if they are the original author
-   user can delete a _FREE_TEXT_ note if they are the original author

## _ASSESSMENT_

There are three basic types of assessments: instant, on-demand and periodic:

-   **instant** ("once") assessments are linked to an engagement report, and concern people
    (specific attendees at the engagement) or tasks (that have been addressed in the engagement);
    these should have exactly two related objects: one for the person or task being assessed, and
    one for the report that holds the assessment
-   **on-demand** ("ondemand") assessments are for people, like the Vetting & Screening; these
    should have an `assessmentDate` and optionally an `expirationDate`, and exactly one related
    object: the person being assessed
-   **periodic** (daily, weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually)
    assessments can be for people or tasks, and should have at most one assessment per defined
    period; these should have exactly one related object: for the person or task being assessed

Note that authorization groups are applicable only to _ASSESSMENT_ notes. Assessment definitions are
distinguished by the assessmentKey, which is defined in the dictionary and recorded in the note.
Using this key, the type of assessment and its corresponding (optional) authorization groups can be
looked up in the dictionary, and checked against the note. We distinguish groups with read
permission and write permission (which includes create, update and delete, as well as read).

Note that there is a difference between this key being absent from the dictionary, and defining an
empty list for this key. No key for `read` means anyone can read this information, and an empty list
(`read: []`) means nobody can read this information (except for those with write access). The
absence of the `write` key means anyone can write this information, and an empty list  (`write: []`)
means nobody can write this information.
