## Authorization for notes

There are (or there will be) four basic types of notes:

-   _FREE_TEXT_
-   _DIAGRAM_ (future)
-   _CHANGE_RECORD_
-   _ASSESSMENT_

There's also a deprecated type _PARTNER_ASSESSMENT_ that was only used in RSM.

There are two main GraphQL endpoints to manipulate notes, through:

-   `NoteResource::createNote`, `NoteResource::updateNote`, `NoteResource::deleteNote`, which all
    three take exactly one note
-   `ReportResource::updateReportAssessments`, which can take multiple instant assessments for a
    report (assessments for people and tasks of that report can be combined in this call)

These all fully check whether the note or notes passed to it are completely valid. And more
importantly, they also check whether the user is authorized to perform this action.

## _FREE_TEXT_

These are the notes in the sidebar. A _FREE_TEXT_ note can be linked to any number of related
objects.

-   admin can read, create, update and delete any _FREE_TEXT_ note
-   user can read all _FREE_TEXT_ notes for objects they are allowed to see
-   any user can create _FREE_TEXT_ notes
-   user can update a _FREE_TEXT_ note if they are the original author
-   user can delete a _FREE_TEXT_ note if they are the original author

## _DIAGRAM_

These are the (future) notes that will hold the new diagrams. A _DIAGRAM_ note can be linked to any
number of related objects.

-   admin can read, create, update and delete any _DIAGRAM_ note
-   user can read all _DIAGRAM_ notes for objects they are allowed to see
-   any user can create _DIAGRAM_ notes
-   user can update a _DIAGRAM_ note if they are the original author
-   user can delete a _DIAGRAM_ note if they are the original author

## _CHANGE_RECORD_

Only used when tasks are updated, to record changes in `customFieldEnum1` ("Project status"), which
requires the user to fill in a reason for the change as well. A _CHANGE_RECORD_ note must be linked
to exactly one related object: the task it refers to.

-   admin can read, create, update and delete any _CHANGE_RECORD_
-   user can read all _CHANGE_RECORD_ notes for objects they are allowed to see
-   user can create a new _CHANGE_RECORD_, with authorization the same as for the task that is
    updated; note: task permission for changing project status (resulting in a CHANGE_RECORD) is
    currently restricted to admins, see commit a74e8abe9!
-   user can not update a _CHANGE_RECORD_
-   user can not delete a _CHANGE_RECORD_

## _ASSESSMENT_

There are three basic types of assessments: instant, on-demand and periodic:

-   **instant** ("once") assessments are linked to an engagement report, and concern people
    (specific attendees at the engagement) or tasks (that have been addressed in the engagement);
    these should have exactly two related objects: one for the person or task being assessed, and
    one for the report that holds the assessment
-   **on-demand** ("ondemand") assessments are for people, like the Vetting & Screening; these
    should have an `assessmentDate` and optionally an `expirationDate`, and exactly one related
    object: the person being assessed
-   **periodic** (daily, weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually)
    assessments can be for people or tasks, and should have at most one assessment per defined
    period; these should have exactly one related object: for the person or task being assessed

Note that authorization groups are applicable only to _ASSESSMENT_ notes. Assessment definitions are
distinguished by the assessmentKey, which is defined in the dictionary and recorded in the note.
Using this key, the type of assessment and its corresponding (optional) authorization groups can be
looked up in the dictionary, and checked against the note. We distinguish groups with read
permission and write permission (which includes create, update and delete, as well as read).
Example:

```
fields:
  person:
    advisor:
      assessments:
        advisorOnceReportLinguist:
          recurrence: once
          relatedObjectType: report
          authorizationGroupUuids:
            read: ['c21e7321-7ec5-4837-8805-a302f9575754']
            write: ['39a78d51-c351-452c-9206-4305ec8dd76d']
          questions:
            …
          questionSets:
            …
```

### Instant assessments

-   user can read, create, update or delete instant assessments if they are an author of the report
-   if no authorization groups for read or write are defined in the dictionary, user can read any
    instant assessment
-   if authorization groups for read are defined in the dictionary, user can read instant
    assessments if they are in these groups
-   if authorization groups for write are defined in the dictionary, user can read, create, update
    or delete instant assessments if they are in these groups

### On-demand assessments

-   admin can read, create, update and delete any on-demand assessment
-   if no authorization groups for read or write are defined in the dictionary, user can read any
    on-demand assessment
-   if authorization groups for read are defined in the dictionary, user can read on-demand
    assessments if they are in these groups
-   if authorization groups for write are defined in the dictionary, user can read, create, update
    or delete on-demand assessments if they are in these groups

### Periodic assessments

#### For a task:

-   admin can read, create, update and delete any periodic assessment
-   user has to be responsible for a task to be able to read, create, update or delete
-   if no authorization groups for read or write are defined in the dictionary, user can read any
    periodic assessment
-   if authorization groups for read are defined in the dictionary, user can read periodic
    assessments if they are in these groups
-   if authorization groups for write are defined in the dictionary, user can read, create, update
    or delete periodic assessments if they are in these groups

#### For a person:

-   admin can read, create, update and delete any periodic assessment
-   person has to be user's counterpart to be able to read, create, update or delete
-   if no authorization groups for read or write are defined in the dictionary, user can read any
    periodic assessment
-   if authorization groups for read are defined in the dictionary, user can read periodic
